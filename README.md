📊 Student Marks Data Analysis System (Python – No Libraries)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
📌 Project Overview
-
This is a menu-driven Student Marks Data Analysis System developed using pure Python without any external libraries (no pandas, numpy, etc.).
The system performs statistical analysis on student marks stored in a CSV file, allowing users to compute mean, median, variance, quartiles, and more, directly through the console.

It is designed to help learners practically understand statistics concepts while strengthening Python fundamentals and file handling skills.

🎯 Objectives
-
Perform data analysis without using external libraries.

Learn CSV file handling in Python.

Understand statistics concepts practically.

Build a menu-driven console application.

Strengthen Python programming fundamentals.

🧠 Statistics Concepts Covered
-
Mean (Average)

Median

Mode

Variance

Standard Deviation

Quartiles (Q1, Q2, Q3)

Interquartile Range (IQR)

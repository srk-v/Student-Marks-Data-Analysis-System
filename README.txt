===========================================================
        STUDENT MARKS DATA ANALYSIS SYSTEM
        (Pure Python – No External Libraries)
===========================================================

PROJECT OVERVIEW
----------------
The Student Marks Data Analysis System is a menu-driven Python
application designed to perform basic data analysis on student
academic records stored in a CSV file.

This project is developed using ONLY core Python concepts
without using any external libraries such as pandas or numpy.
It demonstrates strong understanding of data handling,
statistical calculations, and logical problem-solving.


OBJECTIVES
----------
• To read and process student data from a CSV file
• To perform data analysis using pure Python
• To calculate total marks, average, rankings, and toppers
• To understand file handling and menu-driven programs
• To apply basic statistical concepts to real-world data


FEATURES
--------
1. Read student marks from CSV file
2. Display all student records
3. Calculate total marks and average
4. Determine pass/fail status
5. Identify class topper
6. Identify subject-wise toppers
7. Generate rank list
8. Handle large datasets (1000+ records)
9. Menu-driven and user-friendly


TECHNOLOGIES USED
-----------------
• Programming Language : Python 3
• File Handling        : CSV
• Libraries Used       : NONE (Pure Python)
• Platform             : Windows / Linux / MacOS


PROJECT FILES
-------------
1. main.py
   - Contains the complete menu-driven Python program

2. students.csv
   - CSV file containing student marks data
   - Format:
     Name,Maths,Science,English

3. README.txt
   - Project documentation and usage instructions


CSV FILE FORMAT
---------------
Name,Maths,Science,English
Student_1_Ravi,85,78,90
Student_2_Sita,92,88,95
Student_3_Venkatesh,70,65,72


HOW TO RUN THE PROJECT
---------------------
1. Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system
2. Keep main.py and students.csv in the same folder
3. Open Command Prompt / Terminal in that folder
4. Run the following command:

   python main.py

5. Select options from the menu to perform analysis


MENU OPTIONS
------------
1. Display Student Data
2. Student Total & Average
3. Class Topper
4. Subject-wise Topper
5. Rank List
6. Exit


DATA ANALYSIS LOGIC
-------------------
• Total Marks   = Maths + Science + English
• Average       = Total / 3
• Pass Criteria = Average >= 40
• Ranking       = Sorted based on total marks (descending)
• Toppers       = Maximum marks comparison using loops


STATISTICAL CONCEPTS USED
-------------------------
• Measures of Central Tendency (Total, Average)
• Measures of Comparison (Maximum, Ranking)
• Basic Data Aggregation
• Decision Making (Pass / Fail)


ADVANTAGES OF THIS PROJECT
--------------------------
• No external libraries used
• Easy to understand and explain in viva
• Strong core Python logic
• Suitable for beginners and intermediates
• Can handle large datasets efficiently
• Resume and interview-friendly


LIMITATIONS
-----------
• No graphical user interface (GUI)
• No database integration
• No graphical charts


FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS
-------------------
• Add variance and standard deviation calculations
• Add student record insert/update/delete
• Integrate database (MySQL / SQLite)
• Add GUI using Tkinter
• Convert into web application using Flask or Django


APPLICATIONS
------------
• Academic projects
• Python learning and practice
• Data analysis fundamentals
• Interview and viva demonstration
• GitHub portfolio showcase
